                <h2>Dryer Lint</h2>
                <p>
                Your dryer accumulates large amounts of lint over time. 
                Lint builds up within the vent, inside the machine, and can get attached to the heating element. 
                When this happens, the lint could cause the dryer to overheat and, potentially, catch on fire.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                That is why it is critical to clean the lint trap every time you use your dryer. 
                And that is also a reason that every time LAR's technicians work with dryers, they also clean them from the inside.
